# Git Basics

* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - I can use this anytime to see the currents status of 
the repository
* `git add <file>` - places the file in the git staging area
* `git commit` - commites file to repository
* `git diff` - shows difference between repository and unadded local 
file(s)
* `git log` - show log
